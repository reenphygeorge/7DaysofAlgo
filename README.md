## What is 7 Days of Algorithm?
7 Days of Algorithm is a community driven programming contest, the primary aim of
which is to introduce problem solving through algorithms to the students. 
The event is scheduled to happen between 21<sup>st</sup> June to 21<sup>th</sup>
of June.

## I have a doubt. What do I do?
You three options here:
- Open an issue detailing your doubt.
- Ask in the Official Community Group of Nexus SJCET.
- Send us a mail. (Slow)

## How will this go down?
- Students will be asked to implement a specific algorithm in a language of
  their choice. The code should be submitted to 
  [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexussjcet/7DaysofAlgo) as a pull
  request along with their explanation of how their implementation works, in a
  folder with name every round.
- The submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their code quality,
  correctness, the quality of their explanation and their overall involvement in
  the contest. The submissions will be checked for plagiarism.
- There will be seven rounds in total (1 challenge a day). 
- The students will be given 24 hours (4PM to 4PM) to solve the problem.
- We won't be doing code reviews. If your logic is flawed or if your code has 
  syntax errors we will not suggest corrections. However you will still be 
  evaluated for the same. In short Syntax Errors and Logic Errors won't prevent 
  your submission from getting merged but you will loose points during evaluation. 
  Just like in a regular competition.
- However if you do not place your submission in the right folder or move/edit 
  the Submission Template.md or any other file other than yours, your PR will not 
  be merged.
- Using libraries such as stdio.h (C/C++) ,os (Python), Math (JS) etc are totally 
  fine as they are part of the  standard library but the libraries that requires 
  you do some form of installation (eg. numpy, num2words, number-to-words etc.) are 
  not allowed. 

## Pre-requisites for the contest
- A Desktop PC/ Laptop.
- Basic knowledge in any one programming langugage.
- You should be able to use Git and GitHub.
