# Explanation
#### In this program, user can enter two values and get it's factor and multiple.
<br/>This program does the following
          <br/>* **If both numbers are equal:** It returns the number itself as it's factor and multiple.
          <br/>* **If one of the number is zero:** Returns '0',because it is not a factor or multiple of any number.
          <br/>* **If one or both number is prime:** Returns '1' as the largest factor and the product of the two numbers as multiple.
          <br/>* **If non of the above:** The program uses 'for' loop to find it's largest factor and "product/factor" as the multiple.
<br/><br/>Thank you
