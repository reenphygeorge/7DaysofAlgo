# Challenge 7: Factors and Multiples.
## Problem Statement 

    Write a pure function that take two numbers as an input and finds the 
    i. largest number that completely divides both numbers.
    2. the smallest number that is the product of both numbers.

Most modern languages will have a standard library method/function to achieve these 
functionalities but since this is the last challenge of our contest let's make it a 
litlle more interesting. For this challenge you are not suppose to use those math functions 
but build your own algoritm to find solution to the above problem. **Happy Coding!**

## Feel free to use one of following languages:
- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript/Typescript
- Python
- go
